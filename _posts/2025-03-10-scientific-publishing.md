## A history of scientific publishing

Modern science is tied closely to the publishing system. The publication of ‘impactful’ papers is the primary output of scientific work and is closely tied to career progression of each scientist. Getting publishing right is therefore important to maximise the genuine utility of science for humanity.

My view is that the current system has significant flaws which act as a brake on scientific progress.

There is an opportunity to build a better system, built on a modern technology stack, which serves scientists and other parties far better. I will be posting a series of articles on this topic, of which this is the first. This article discusses the broad history of scientific publishing and how the modern system has emerged over the past 500 years.

In 1678, Huygens developed his wave theory of light, proposing that light propagates as waves - a groundbreaking idea. To protect his claim to this discovery, Huygens wrote down his theory and sent a sealed letter to the French Academy of Sciences. The purpose of this was to provide proof of his work without immediately revealing the details to others, ensuring that if someone else announced a similar idea, he could demonstrate he had the concept first.

This technique was a common way for scientists in the 17th and 18th centuries to safeguard their intellectual property while avoiding premature exposure to criticism or the risk of someone else taking credit.

Recognizing the need for a better system, the establishment of scientific societies such as the Royal Society of London and its journal, Philosophical Transactions (1665), marked a pivotal shift. These journals allowed scientists to publicly share discoveries while securely claiming priority, laying the foundation for a culture of openness and collaboration – but the change did not happen quickly.

In the decades following the founding of journals like Philosophical Transactions (1665) and the Journal des Sçavans (1665), many scientists remained hesitant to publish their findings openly. The culture of science at the time still valued private correspondence, secrecy, and establishing priority through sealed letters or limited disclosure. Scientists often feared criticism, intellectual theft, or losing the competitive edge that secrecy provided. Journals were new, and their role in validating and disseminating discoveries was not yet universally recognized.

Over time, the scientific publishing system evolved to include peer review, ensuring the credibility and quality of shared work. By the 19th century, publication became central to a scientist’s career, driving rapid knowledge exchange and accelerating discovery. This shift from secrecy to open publication not only resolved priority disputes but also transformed science into a collective enterprise, laying the foundation for modern research. The creation of scientific publishing and its progressive adoption was more than an administrative improvement—it was a leap forward, enabling the exponential growth of human knowledge and innovation.

The physical distribution of scientific works in the pre-digital era was a monumental logistical challenge. Early journals were printed in small quantities and distributed through slow and unreliable postal services or personal networks. As printing technology improved in the 19th century, larger print runs and the rise of libraries as central repositories made scientific works more accessible, but costs and time delays remained significant. By the 20th century, industrial printing and modern transportation allowed for mass distribution, yet international shipping, subscription logistics, and physical storage continued to impose substantial barriers. These technological constraints shaped a system reliant on costly subscriptions and institutional access, ensuring that only well-funded organizations could participate fully in the scientific enterprise.

The post-World War II era brought significant changes to scientific publishing, driven by the rapid expansion of government-funded research and the growing complexity of scientific disciplines. The increasing volume of research created a pressing need for professionalized publishing systems capable of managing and disseminating vast amounts of information. Commercial publishers like Elsevier and Springer rose to meet these demands, standardizing editorial processes, improving the quality of publications, and ensuring regular production schedules. Their global distribution networks made it easier for researchers to access the latest findings, addressing the challenge of sharing knowledge across an increasingly interconnected scientific community. In a pre-digital era, these publishers played a crucial role in bridging regional divides, supporting the development of specialized journals, and helping science keep pace with its own explosive growth.

The evolution of scientific publishing over the 19th and 20th centuries saw the gradual shift from society-led journals to a system increasingly dominated by commercial publishers. In the mid-19th century, companies like Springer (founded in 1842) and Elsevier (founded in 1880) were established, initially focusing on publishing books and journals that served academic audiences. During this period, academic societies still managed most scientific journals, but the increasing volume of research and the logistical challenges of editing, printing, and distributing journals placed significant strain on their resources. Commercial publishers like Springer and Elsevier stepped in to alleviate this burden by taking over the production and distribution processes, allowing societies and institutions to focus on advancing scientific content rather than managing operational complexities. By standardizing workflows and leveraging economies of scale, these publishers reduced the overall costs of journal production and improved distribution networks, ensuring that research could reach a wider, international audience more efficiently. This commercialized approach represented a significant improvement in the accessibility and sustainability of scientific publishing at the time.

The post-World War II era marked a turning point as government-funded research programs fuelled an explosion in scientific output, accelerating the need for efficient publishing systems. Commercial publishers stepped in to handle the growing complexity, acquiring smaller journals and society publications to consolidate their operations. By offering consistent publishing schedules, rigorous editorial processes, and international distribution, they became indispensable to the scientific community. However, this expansion also set the stage for the progressive monopolization of scientific publishing. By the late 20th century, companies like Elsevier, Springer, and Wiley controlled an increasingly large share of journals.

The digitization of science in the late 20th century was a transformative phase for scientific publishing, revolutionizing how knowledge was produced, accessed, and shared. With the advent of the internet and digital technologies, publishers began shifting from traditional print journals to electronic platforms. Major players like Elsevier and Springer were early adopters, creating online repositories such as ScienceDirect and SpringerLink, which centralized vast collections of journals and made them instantly accessible to researchers worldwide. This transition dramatically increased the speed of information dissemination, reduced production costs, and allowed for powerful search and indexing capabilities that transformed how researchers interacted with the literature.

Digitization also led to the rise of subscription bundling, where publishers offered libraries access to large portfolios of journals in "big deals." While these bundles increased access to a broader range of content, they also entrenched the dominance of major publishers, as institutions became dependent on their platforms. Moreover, the digitization era saw the emergence of paywalls, which restricted access to non-subscribers, highlighting a growing tension between the profit-driven motives of publishers and the scientific community’s desire for open knowledge. Despite these challenges, digitization laid the groundwork for innovations like open access publishing, preprint repositories, and new tools for collaboration and knowledge sharing, marking both opportunities and obstacles in the pursuit of more equitable science.

While scientific publishing has advanced significantly over the past half-century, it is burdened by flaws that are holding back modern science— many of these flaws are scars from its history. Publishers charge exorbitant fees for both publishing and access, often ranging from £3,000 to £10,000 per paper. These costs are typically only affordable for large institutions, which are themselves funded primarily by taxpayers, creating a system that paradoxically limits access to publicly funded research. The publishing process remains agonizingly slow, with papers frequently taking a year or more from submission to publication.

Despite radical technological advancements over the past five centuries, the format of scientific papers has changed remarkably little. Figures are static and lack interactivity, datasets are often inaccessible, and support for dynamic content such as videos or animations is minimal. Perhaps most troubling is that the content of these papers—produced almost entirely by scientists and funded largely by taxpayers—is owned by the publishing companies rather than the researchers or the public. These systemic issues not only hinder the progress of science but also undermine its accessibility and transparency.

The five main opportunities for improvement are as follows:

1. Improvement in the speed of writing, peer review and publication.

2. Improvement in the accuracy of distribution

3. Reduction in cost for publication.

4. Dynamic content

5. Returning ownership of content to scientists.

There are several interesting organisations working in this space currently, including AI peer review, preprint servers, semantic search for papers, using websites instead of pdfs for hosting science content, and a number of fields abandoning peer reviewed journals altogether.
