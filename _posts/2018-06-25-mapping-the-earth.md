John Harrison. The 39th most influential Brit. A title he earned, despite few knowing of him, by creating immensely accurate mechanical clocks. Accurate mechanical timekeeping was the bedrock of British map-making in the 1700s. Without it, it is unlikely Britain would have achieved the global dominance it did. Harrison’s legacy of British map-making facilitated international trade and the beginnings of globalisation.
