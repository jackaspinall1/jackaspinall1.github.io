It is tempting to demonise fossil fuels as an evil that must be ousted. To paint companies that extract them as self-interested capitalist beasts, to associate them with unjust war and environmental disaster. The conversation needs broadening and re-grounding in reality. Cheap energy is the bedrock of society. The foundation upon which modern life is built. A force that has lifted the quality of life for all.
